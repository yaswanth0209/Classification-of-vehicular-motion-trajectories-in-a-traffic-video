# Classification-of-vehicular-motion-trajectories-in-a-traffic-video
Vehicle trajectory classification is an essential task in various applications, including traffic management, autonomous driving, and transportation analysis. It involves categorizing the movement patterns and paths followed by vehicles on road networks. There are several ways to classify vehicle trajectories, depending on the criteria and objectives of the classification.

As first phase of this project tracking has been done.
# Segmentation
Segmentation has been done three phases
1)Background detection
2)Vehicle Detection
3)Shadow detection and removal
## Background detection
==> Histogram based approach
